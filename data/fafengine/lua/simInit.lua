-- Engine hook (data/fafengine, mounted by the engine at /fafengine and registered as a hook directory): appended to /lua/simInit.lua.
--
-- Runs an optional test script after the session has begun: if the file /fafengine/lua/test/dynlights_test.lua exists it is executed in
-- the sim (it forks its own threads). The file is not part of the engine (tests/lights/ingame/ in the repository holds it, copy it to
-- <exe folder>/fafengine/lua/test/ to use it), so on a normal install nothing happens and the check is one file lookup.
