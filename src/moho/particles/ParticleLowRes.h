// Large particles in a lower-resolution target (docs/RENDERER_BACKENDS.md, "Large particles in a lower-resolution
// target").
//
// The explosions of the game are a few hundred quads of 100,000 pixels and more, drawn over each other with blending:
// 100 and more screens of overdraw, which costs blend/ROP bandwidth and nothing else. This path draws the quads at or
// above a size threshold into a half (or quarter) resolution target and composites it onto the scene; everything
// smaller stays at full resolution.
//
// How (all of it behind the effect patch of ParticleEffectPatch.h, so Direct3D 11, 12 and Vulkan and nothing else):
//   - the scene depth is copied (the scene's own depth stays a depth output) and downsampled once per RenderEffects
//     call (the farthest depth of each low-resolution pixel's footprint, into the depth buffer of the low-resolution
//     target);
//   - for a run of buckets (same sort scalar; the bucket order of the game is ALPHABLEND, PREMODALPHA, ADD in any mix)
//     the large quads are drawn into a cleared accumulation target with the `_LR` techniques (depth tested by the
//     hardware), the target is composited onto the scene with a depth-aware upsample, then the small quads of the same
//     buckets are drawn at full resolution;
//   - only buckets that could hold a large quad from this camera take part (an estimate kept per pooled particle
//     buffer); the others, and runs without such a bucket, draw once at full resolution exactly as before;
//   - one instanced draw per bucket is issued twice from the same data; the vertex shader collapses the quads of the
//     other size class (the size is a function of the instance data and the camera only, so both draws agree on which
//     quad is which).
// The soft particles (docs/RENDERER_BACKENDS.md, "Soft particles") share this file's runtime because they need the
// same thing: a sampled copy of the scene depth, taken once per RenderEffects call before the particle pass, and the
// patched particle effect. They work with the low-resolution path off or on (the low-resolution passes read the same
// copy at full resolution).
// ADD and the "over" blends (ALPHABLEND, PREMODALPHA) accumulate together in their drawing order (see
// ParticleEffectPatch.h), which is exact up to the 8 bit clamping of the scene. MODULATE*, REFRACT and TLight buckets
// are not touched; they end a run.
