// Source-level patch of FAF's mesh.fx and terrain.fx that adds the dynamic lights (docs/DYNAMIC_LIGHTS.md, "Shader side").
//
// The game's effect files are user data and are never copied into this repository: the patch runs on the text that is about to be
// compiled (CD3DEffect::InitEffectFromFile), on the Direct3D 11/12/Vulkan backends only (Direct3D 9 keeps the FA-Binary-Patches
// version). It is a port of the FA-DynamicLights generator (make_lab_shaders.py) with one change of design: the lights are not
// constant arrays walked in three or four extra passes, but the light data and light grid textures of LightGrid.h, read in ONE extra
// pass (meshes) / one extra pass plus the decal and splat lighting (terrain). Nothing else of the effect changes except what the
// light pass needs: the vertex shaders that feed the lit mesh techniques also store the view distance in an unused interpolator.
//
// Pure text in, text out; no engine headers. An unexpected source (a FAF update that moved something this patch relies on) leaves the
// text untouched and says why in `error`, so the effect still compiles, without lights.
//
// Effect parameters the patched text declares (see LightBinding.h): dynLightData, dynLightGrid, dynLightParams, dynLightGridSize,
// dynLightDataSize, and in the mesh effect dynLightCamera (world position of the camera; the pixel shaders rebuild the world position
// from the view distance). Technique annotation `int dynLightPasses = 1;` marks a technique whose LAST pass is the light pass: the
// effect runtime drops it from the pass count while no light is active.

  {
    bool patched = false;
    int techniques = 0; // techniques that got the light pass
    std::string error;  // why nothing was patched, when `patched` is false
  };

  // `flood` is a diagnostic (/dynlightsflood = 1): the light passes paint every pixel magenta; 2 (/dynlightsflood2) paints what the terrain pass finds: red = the light parameters arrived, green = the grid cell has a light, blue = the light data texture holds a light. Otherwise it only paints magenta instead of reading the lights, which shows
  // whether the passes run at all, apart from whether the light data is right.
