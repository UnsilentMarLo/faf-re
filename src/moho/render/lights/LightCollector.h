// The light pool: feeds offer Emissions (a thing that glows, with its birth time, life and motion), Update(now) turns the live ones into
// the Lights of this frame (position, radius, colour x intensity), ranked by power and capped.
//
// Pure data and arithmetic, no engine headers and no GPU: compiled on its own by the host test (tests/lights). Render only; nothing
// here reads or writes sim state. Single-threaded: the feeds and Update run on the thread that renders.
//
// Times are sim ticks as floats (tick + sub-tick fraction); the caller supplies the same clock the particle shaders use
// (REN_GetGameTick() + frame alpha).
