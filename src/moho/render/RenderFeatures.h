// FAF addition: the registry of renderer features (docs/RENDERER_BACKENDS.md, "Render features").
//
// Every visual feature the engine adds on top of the shipped renderer (dynamic lights, post-process anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion,
// large-particle quality, ...) is registered here once, with what each render API can do with it. The registry does three things:
//   - the Options > Video entry of the feature is built from it (data/fafengine/lua/options/options.lua asks the engine for the features of
//     the active API through the Lua function GetRenderFeatures), so a feature appears only on the APIs that support it, with the levels and the
//     default that API supports;
//   - the engine asks it for the level the player chose (FeatureLevel) instead of reading a command-line switch and a console variable of its own;
//   - the support table is the one place that says why an API does not get a feature (shown as the tip's last line and in the docs).
//
// The level of a feature is the index of the chosen state (0 = off). It is stored in the profile as the *key string* of the state, like the
// Graphics API option, so a profile survives a reordered list.
