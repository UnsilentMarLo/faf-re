// toroidal grid of 1024 x 1024 cells of one world unit that follows the camera over the water. Units standing in the water leave wakes, the
// impacts and explosions at the surface throw rings. The result (slope and height, one RGBA16F texture) bends the normal the water pixel
// shader uses, so the reflection, the refraction, the sun glints and the light glints of the field all see the waves, and pushes the wave
// crest colour (foam) where the water is high.
//
// Render only: the simulation never sees any of it (replays stay in step), and nothing here feeds back to the units. Cost: one compute
// dispatch of 1024 x 1024 cells per step (at most 6 steps a frame, 90 a second) and one copy draw.
