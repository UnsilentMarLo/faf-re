// Source-level patch of FAF's water2.fx that filters the two lookups the water pixel shader makes with a screen position the wave normal has
// moved (docs/WATER_QUALITY.md, "Shader side"): the refraction map (the scene before the water) and the reflection map (the mirrored units).
//
// The shipped pixel shader reads both with one bilinear tap at `screenPos - N.xz * depth * refractionScale`. The normal map has a repeat rate
// of 0.5 per world unit in its finest layer, so neighbouring screen pixels land several texels apart and the lookup aliases: reflected units
// and the sea floor shimmer and crawl, and the edge of a reflected hull is a staircase. The patch replaces the two lookups with a filter whose
// footprint is the screen-space derivative of the lookup position (what a mip level / anisotropic filter would do for a texture that cannot
// have mips), taken with 4 or 8 taps weighted by the reflection's alpha so a reflected edge fades into the sky instead of into black.
//
// Pure text in, text out; no engine headers. The effect parameter `faf_WaterFilter` (float3: reflection taps, refraction taps, shoreline blend; all 0 =
// the shipped lookups) is declared by the patch and set by WaterQuality every frame. A source the patch does not recognise (a FAF update that
// changed the shader) is left untouched and `error` says why, so the effect still compiles, unfiltered.
